2.Speed and Efficiency: It creates software that works quickly and saves time.

3.Security: Software engineers make sure programs are safe from hackers and keep information secure.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Here are three key milestones in software engineering:

1. Programming Languages (1950s): Early programs were written in hard-to-understand machine code. Languages like **FORTRAN** and **COBOL** made coding easier and faster.

2. Structured Programming (1960s-1970s): This method organized code into smaller, manageable parts, making it easier to read and fix.

3. Agile Methodology (2001): Agile focuses on working in short cycles, delivering parts of the software quickly, and adapting to changes easily.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) has several phases that guide the process of building software. Here are the key phases:

1. **Planning**: Defining the project’s goals and requirements. It includes figuring out what the software needs to do.

2. **Analysis**: Understanding and documenting the specific requirements of the software. This phase ensures the team knows what the user expects.

3. **Design**: Creating the architecture or blueprint for how the software will work. This includes the user interface and system design.

4. **Development**: Writing the actual code based on the design. This is where the software is built.

5. **Testing**: Checking the software for bugs and making sure it works as expected. Fixing any issues found.

6. **Deployment**: Releasing the software to users, either for testing or for use in the real world.

7. **Maintenance**: Updating and improving the software over time, fixing any bugs, and adding new features as needed.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
### Waterfall vs. Agile:

1. **Waterfall**:
   - **Linear**: Follows a step-by-step process where each phase must be finished before the next starts.
   - **Rigid**: Hard to make changes once a phase is complete.
   - **Heavy Documentation**: Focuses on detailed planning and documentation.

   **Example**: Used for projects with fixed requirements, like government or infrastructure software.

2. **Agile**:
   - **Iterative**: Develops the project in small cycles (sprints), allowing constant improvements.
   - **Flexible**: Easily adapts to changing requirements during development.
   - **Minimal Documentation**: Emphasizes working software over documents.

   **Example**: Works best for projects with changing needs, like mobile apps or startup products.

### Comparison:
- **Flexibility**: Agile is adaptable; Waterfall is rigid.
- **Process**: Waterfall is linear, Agile is cyclical.
- **Risk**: Agile lowers risk through continuous changes, while Waterfall can be risky if changes are needed later.

### Contrast:
- Waterfall fits stable projects; Agile suits changing, evolving environments.
